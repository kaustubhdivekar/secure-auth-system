### 5. Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the main To-Let Globe monorepo and navigate into the backend directory:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/kaustubhdivekar/to-let-globe.git](https://github.com/kaustubhdivekar/to-let-globe.git)
cd to-let-globe/backend
```

Environment Setup
This project uses a .env file to store environment-specific configurations and sensitive credentials.

Create a .env file:
Copy the example file to create your local environment configuration:

```Bash

cp .env.example .env
```
Edit .env:
Open the newly created .env file and fill in the required variables. Refer to the Environment Variables section for detailed descriptions of each variable.

Ensure MONGODB_URI points to your MongoDB instance (local or Atlas).
Set a strong, unique JWT_SECRET.
Configure email settings (use Ethereal.email credentials for development/testing).
Set FRONTEND_URL to your frontend application's URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173 for local development).
Set ADMIN_EMAIL to the email address where you want to receive contact form notifications.
Installing Dependencies
Install the project dependencies using npm:

```Bash

npm install
```
Running the Application
Development Mode (with Nodemon for auto-restarts):

```Bash

npm run dev
```
The server will typically start on the port specified in your .env file (default: 5001). You should see console logs indicating server startup and MongoDB connection status.

Production Mode:

```Bash

npm start
```
This command runs the server using node server.js. Ensure your NODE_ENV in .env is set to production when deploying for production environments.

### 9. Scripts

The following npm scripts are available in package.json for development and testing:

npm start: Starts the server in production mode (node server.js).
npm run dev: Starts the server in development mode with nodemon for automatic reloading on file changes.
npm test: Runs all Jest tests (jest --runInBand).
npm run test:watch: Runs Jest tests in watch mode (re-runs tests on file changes).
npm run test:coverage: Runs Jest tests and generates a detailed code coverage report (output in the coverage/ directory).
npm run lint: Lints the codebase using ESLint to identify code quality issues.
npm run format: Automatically formats the codebase using Prettier to enforce consistent styling.

---

### 10. Security Features

To ensure a robust and secure API, the following security measures are implemented:

Password Hashing: User passwords are never stored in plain text. bcryptjs is used to securely hash and salt them, making them highly resistant to common attacks like rainbow tables.

JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens are employed for secure, stateless user sessions. Tokens are cryptographically signed with a strong, secret key (JWT_SECRET) to prevent tampering and ensure authenticity.

HTTPS Enforcement (Production): While this Node.js application itself doesn't directly enforce HTTPS (this is typically handled by a reverse proxy or the hosting platform), using HTTPS is absolutely crucial for production deployments to encrypt all data in transit.

Input Validation: express-validator is used to rigorously validate all incoming request data on the server-side. This helps prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and ensures data integrity.

Environment Variables: Sensitive information such as database credentials, JWT secrets, and API keys are stored in .env files and are strictly excluded from version control (.gitignore).

Security Headers: The helmet middleware is integrated to set various HTTP headers that enhance security by protecting against common web vulnerabilities, including XSS, clickjacking, and others.

Rate Limiting: express-rate-limit middleware is configured to prevent brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints and other sensitive routes by limiting the number of requests per IP address within a specified time window.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): The cors middleware is properly configured to manage access to the API, typically allowing requests only from the specified frontend URL, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.

Token Hashing for Verification/Reset: Email verification and password reset tokens sent to users are distinct from the (hashed) versions stored in the database. This adds an extra layer of security, as even if a token is intercepted, it cannot be directly used to gain access.

Principle of Least Privilege (via Roles): The authorizeRoles middleware ensures that users can only access API resources and perform actions that are appropriate for their assigned role, enforcing granular access control.

---

### 11. Testing

This project utilizes Jest for unit and integration testing. Supertest is used for making HTTP requests to test API endpoints, and MongoDB Memory Server provides an isolated, in-memory MongoDB instance for tests, ensuring tests are fast and don't affect your development database.

Running Unit/Integration Tests

To run all tests:

```Bash

npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode (tests automatically re-run on file changes):

```Bash

npm run test:watch
```
To generate a detailed code coverage report (output will be in the coverage/ directory):

```Bash

npm run test:coverage
```
You can then open coverage/lcov-report/index.html in your web browser to view the interactive report.

Test files are organized within the __tests__ directory, mirroring the structure of the code they are testing (e.g., __tests__/controllers/authController.test.js).

---

### 12. Code Style & Linting

To maintain code consistency and quality across the project, the following tools are integrated:

ESLint: Used for static code analysis to find problematic patterns, potential errors, and code that doesnâ€™t adhere to defined style guidelines. The configuration is found in .eslintrc.js.

Prettier: Functions as an opinionated code formatter to ensure a consistent and readable code style across the entire codebase. The configuration is in .prettierrc.json.

To lint the code:

```Bash

npm run lint
```
To automatically format the code:

```Bash

npm run format
```
It's highly recommended to integrate these tools with your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as VS Code, for real-time feedback and automatic format-on-save functionality.
