* **(Optional) A REST Client:** Tools like Postman, Insomnia, or the VS Code REST Client extension for testing API endpoints.

---

## 5. Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the main To-Let Globe monorepo and navigate into the backend directory:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/to-let-globe.git](https://github.com/your-username/to-let-globe.git)
cd to-let-globe/backend
````

**Note:** Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

### Environment Setup

This project uses a `.env` file to store environment-specific configurations and sensitive credentials.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Copy the example file to create your local environment configuration:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit `.env`:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in the required variables. Refer to the [Environment Variables](https://www.google.com/search?q=%237-environment-variables) section for detailed descriptions of each variable.

      * Ensure `MONGODB_URI` points to your MongoDB instance (local or Atlas).
      * Set a strong, unique `JWT_SECRET`.
      * Configure email settings (use Ethereal.email credentials for development/testing).
      * Set `FRONTEND_URL` to your frontend application's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for local development).
      * Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` to the email address where you want to receive contact form notifications.

### Installing Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

  * **Development Mode (with Nodemon for auto-restarts):**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The server will typically start on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: `5001`). You should see console logs indicating server startup and MongoDB connection status.

  * **Production Mode:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command runs the server using `node server.js`. Ensure your `NODE_ENV` in `.env` is set to `production` when deploying for production environments.

## 9\. Scripts

The following npm scripts are available in `package.json` for development and testing:

  * `npm start`: Starts the server in production mode (`node server.js`).
  * `npm run dev`: Starts the server in development mode with `nodemon` for automatic reloading on file changes.
  * `npm test`: Runs all Jest tests (`jest --runInBand`).
  * `npm run test:watch`: Runs Jest tests in watch mode (re-runs tests on file changes).
  * `npm run test:coverage`: Runs Jest tests and generates a detailed code coverage report (output in the `coverage/` directory).
  * `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint to identify code quality issues.
  * `npm run format`: Automatically formats the codebase using Prettier to enforce consistent styling.

-----

## 10\. Security Features

To ensure a robust and secure API, the following security measures are implemented:

  * **Password Hashing:** User passwords are never stored in plain text. Instead, `bcryptjs` is used to securely hash and salt them, making them resistant to rainbow table attacks.
  * **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens are employed for secure, stateless user sessions. Tokens are cryptographically signed with a strong, secret key (`JWT_SECRET`) to prevent tampering.
  * **HTTPS Enforcement (Production):** While not enforced directly by this Node.js application (as it's typically handled by a reverse proxy like Nginx or the hosting platform), using HTTPS is absolutely crucial for production deployments to encrypt data in transit.
  * **Input Validation:** `express-validator` is used to rigorously validate all incoming request data on the server-side. This helps prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and ensures data integrity.
  * **Environment Variables:** Sensitive information such as database credentials, JWT secrets, and API keys are stored in `.env` files and explicitly excluded from version control (`.gitignore`).
  * **Security Headers:** The `helmet` middleware is integrated to set various HTTP headers that help protect against common web vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and others.
  * **Rate Limiting:** `express-rate-limit` middleware is configured to prevent brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints and other sensitive routes by limiting the number of requests per IP address within a specified time window.
  * **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** The `cors` middleware is properly configured to manage access to the API, typically allowing requests only from the specified frontend URL.
  * **Token Hashing for Verification/Reset:** Email verification and password reset tokens sent to users are distinct from the (hashed) versions stored in the database. This adds an extra layer of security, as even if a token is intercepted, it cannot be directly used to gain access.
  * **Principle of Least Privilege (via Roles):** The `authorizeRoles` middleware ensures that users can only access API resources and perform actions that are appropriate for their assigned role, enforcing access control.

-----

## 11\. Testing

This project utilizes Jest for unit and integration testing. Supertest is used for making HTTP requests to test API endpoints, and MongoDB Memory Server provides an isolated, in-memory MongoDB instance for tests, ensuring tests are fast and don't affect your development database.

### Running Unit/Integration Tests

  * To run all tests:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

  * To run tests in watch mode (tests automatically re-run on file changes):

    ```bash
    npm run test:watch
    ```

  * To generate a detailed code coverage report (output will be in the `coverage/` directory):

    ```bash
    npm run test:coverage
    ```

    You can then open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your web browser to view the interactive report.

Test files are organized within the `__tests__` directory, mirroring the structure of the code they are testing (e.g., `__tests__/controllers/authController.test.js`).

-----

## 12\. Code Style & Linting

To maintain code consistency and quality across the project, the following tools are integrated:

  * **ESLint:** Used for static code analysis to find problematic patterns, potential errors, and code that doesnâ€™t adhere to defined style guidelines. The configuration is found in `.eslintrc.js`.

  * **Prettier:** Functions as an opinionated code formatter to ensure a consistent and readable code style across the entire codebase. The configuration is in `.prettierrc.json`.

  * To lint the code:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

  * To automatically format the code:

    ```bash
    npm run format
    ```

It's highly recommended to integrate these tools with your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as VS Code, for real-time feedback and automatic format-on-save functionality.
