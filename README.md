# To-Let Globe Monorepo

**Version: 1.0.0**
**Last Updated: June 10, 2025**

This monorepo houses the complete source code for **To-Let Globe**, a full-stack web application designed to streamline property listings and facilitate interactions between tenants and landlords. It features a robust Node.js/Express.js backend API and a dynamic React.js frontend. The system includes comprehensive user authentication, secure data handling, and essential communication features.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

To-Let Globe aims to simplify the renting and leasing process by providing a secure, flexible, and modern platform. The project demonstrates best practices in decoupled architecture, utilizing JWT for authentication, email-based account management, secure data processing, and integrated communication functionalities (e.g., contact form with notifications). The frontend features a sleek dark theme with vibrant cyan and gold gradient accents, aligning with contemporary UI/UX principles.

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get the To-Let Globe application running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the monorepo to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/kaustubhdivekar/to-let-globe.git](https://github.com/kaustubhdivekar/to-let-globe.git)
cd to-let-globe
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
You will need to set up .env files for both the backend and frontend applications. These files will contain sensitive information and local configurations, and are excluded from version control by .gitignore.

Backend Environment (backend/.env)
Navigate into the backend directory:

```Bash

cd backend
```
Create the .env file by copying from the example:

```Bash

cp .env.example .env
```
Open the newly created .env file and fill in your details:

```
MONGODB_URI: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string (e.g., mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xyz.mongodb.net/to-let-globe?retryWrites=true&w=majority).
JWT_SECRET: A very strong, random secret string for JWT signing. You can generate one with node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))".
JWT_EXPIRES_IN: JWT expiration time (e.g., 1h).
ETHEREAL_USER, ETHEREAL_PASS: Your Ethereal.email credentials for development email testing.
ADMIN_EMAIL: An email address to receive contact form notifications (can be another Ethereal.email address for development).
FRONTEND_URL: http://localhost:5173 (for local frontend development).
NODE_ENV: development
```

Frontend Environment (frontend/.env)
Navigate into the frontend directory (from the backend directory, use cd ../frontend, or from the monorepo root, use cd frontend):

```Bash

cd ../frontend # or cd frontend

```
Create the .env file by copying from the example:

```Bash

cp .env.example .env

```
Open the newly created .env file and fill in your details:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:5001/api (assuming your backend runs on port 5001).
```
### 3. Install Dependencies & Run Services
You will need two separate terminal windows/tabs: one for the backend and one for the frontend.

Backend Setup
In your first terminal, navigate to the backend directory:

```Bash

cd to-let-globe/backend

```
Install dependencies:

```Bash

npm install
Run the backend server:
```
```Bash

npm run dev
```
The backend server will typically run on http://localhost:5001.

Frontend Setup
In your second terminal, navigate to the frontend directory:

```Bash

cd to-let-globe/frontend
```
Install dependencies:

```Bash

npm install
```
Run the frontend development server:

```Bash

npm run dev
```
The frontend application will typically be available at http://localhost:5173.

---

### 4. Access the Application
Once both services are running, open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:5173

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions
This project is configured for continuous deployment using Render for the backend and Vercel for the frontend.

1. MongoDB Atlas Setup

Create a free account on MongoDB Atlas.

Create a new cluster (the free M0 tier is typically sufficient for personal projects).

Configure Network Access: For development, you can temporarily add 0.0.0.0/0 (Allow Access From Anywhere), but for production, narrow this down to specific IP addresses (Render's static IPs) for enhanced security.

Configure Database Access: Create a new database user with a strong username and password. Grant "Read and write to any database" privileges.

Get your Connection String: Go to "Databases," click "Connect" for your cluster, choose "Connect your application," select Node.js driver, and copy the connection string. Replace <username>, <password>, and myFirstDatabase (or your chosen database name) in the string. This is your MONGODB_URI.

2. Backend Deployment (Render)

Push your entire monorepo code to a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository.

Sign up/log in to Render.

Click "New +" and select "Web Service".

Connect your Git repository.

Configure the service:

Name: to-let-globe-backend (or similar)
Region: Choose a region close to your users and database.
Branch: main (or your deployment branch).
Root Directory: backend (Crucial for monorepos: tells Render where the backend project resides).
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm start (or node server.js)
Environment: Node
Environment Variables: Add all necessary variables from your backend/.env file.

NODE_ENV: production
MONGODB_URI: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
JWT_SECRET: The same strong secret used locally.
JWT_EXPIRES_IN: e.g., 1h
EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS, EMAIL_FROM_NAME, EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS: Your production email service credentials.
ADMIN_EMAIL: Your production admin email.
FRONTEND_URL: Initially, use a placeholder or leave blank. You'll update this with your Vercel frontend URL after its deployment.

Select the Free instance type if applicable.

Click "Create Web Service". Render will build and deploy your backend. Note the .onrender.com URL provided.

3. Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

Push your entire monorepo code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

Sign up/log in to Vercel.

Click "Add New..." and select "Project".

Import your Git repository.

Configure the project:

Project Name: to-let-globe-frontend (or similar)
Vercel usually auto-detects React (Vite) projects.
Root Directory: frontend (Crucial for monorepos: tells Vercel where the frontend project resides).
Build Command: Usually auto-detected as npm run build or vite build.
Output Directory: Usually auto-detected as dist.
Environment Variables:

VITE_API_BASE_URL: Set this to your deployed Render backend URL (e.g., https://to-let-globe-backend.onrender.com/api).

Click "Deploy". Vercel will build and deploy your frontend. Note the .vercel.app URL provided.

4. Post-Deployment Updates

Update Render Backend's FRONTEND_URL: Go back to your to-let-globe-backend service on Render. Edit the FRONTEND_URL environment variable to your Vercel frontend URL (e.g., https://to-let-globe-frontend.vercel.app). Trigger a redeploy on Render for this change to take effect.

Verify Deployment: Open your Vercel frontend URL. Test all functionalities, especially login, registration, and the contact/blog forms, to ensure seamless communication with the deployed backend and database.

## ✅ Testing

Backend Testing
Framework: Jest
HTTP Assertions: Supertest
Location: backend/ directory

Run Tests:
```Bash

cd backend
npm test
```
Frontend Testing

(Currently, explicit frontend tests are not configured. If implemented, they would typically use Vitest/Jest and React Testing Library.)

To run (if configured):

```Bash

cd frontend
npm test
```

---

## 📐 Code Quality & Conventions
Linters & Formatters: ESLint and Prettier are configured for both backend and frontend to enforce coding standards and ensure consistent formatting.
To check for linting errors: npm run lint (in respective backend/ or frontend/ directories).
To automatically format code: npm run format (in respective backend/ or frontend/ directories).
Commit Messages: Follow Conventional Commits for clear, structured, and automated changelog-friendly commit history (e.g., feat: Add contact form, fix: Resolve email sending error, docs: Update README).
Branching Strategy: A Gitflow-like model (e.g., main for production-ready code, develop for ongoing development, feature/ branches for new features, bugfix/ for bug fixes) is recommended for organized development.
