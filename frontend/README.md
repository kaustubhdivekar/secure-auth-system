* **Frontend:** [https://to-let-globe-rho.vercel.app/](https://to-let-globe-rho.vercel.app/) 

---

### 6. Prerequisites

Before setting up the frontend, ensure you have:

* **Node.js** (v18.x or later recommended, includes npm).
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
* **The corresponding To-Let Globe Backend API must be running and accessible.** For local development, this typically means the backend server should be running on `http://localhost:5001`. For deployed versions, ensure you have the correct API base URL.

---

### 7. Getting Started

### Backend Setup (Important!)
The frontend relies entirely on the backend API for data. **Before running the frontend, ensure the backend server is running and accessible.**

Please refer to the main [To-Let Globe Monorepo README](../README.md) or the dedicated [Backend README](../backend/README.md) for detailed backend setup and running instructions.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    If you've cloned the monorepo, move into the `frontend` folder:

    ```bash
    cd to-let-globe/frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Open the newly created `.env` file in the frontend root and set the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to point to your running backend API.
    * **Local Backend Example:** `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api`
    * **Deployed Backend Example:** `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://to-let-globe-backend.onrender.com/api` (replace with your actual Render URL)

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser.

---

### 8. Available Scripts

In the frontend project directory, you can run the following npm scripts:

* `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for rapid development.
* `npm run build`: Compiles and optimizes the application for production into the `dist` folder.
* `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues, ensuring adherence to coding standards.
* `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier, maintaining consistent code style across the project.
* `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for testing purposes before deployment.
* `npm test`: (If configured with Vitest/Jest) Executes the test suite for frontend components and logic.

---

### 9. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the frontend root based on `.env.example`. All environment variables exposed to the client-side by Vite must be prefixed with `VITE_`.

* **`VITE_API_BASE_URL`**: **Required.** The base URL for the backend API.
    * Example for local development: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api`
    * Example for deployed backend: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api`

---

### 12. API Integration

All communication with the backend API is centralized through `src/services/apiService.js` and `src/services/authService.js`.

* **`src/services/apiService.js`** configures an `axios` instance with:
    * `baseURL` dynamically set from `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
    * A request interceptor to automatically attach the JWT (retrieved from `localStorage`) to the `Authorization` header for all authenticated requests.
    * A response interceptor to handle global errors (e.g., `401 Unauthorized` responses indicating session expiry, triggering an automatic logout and redirection to the login page).

---

### 13. State Management

* **Global Authentication State:** Managed efficiently using React's **Context API** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`). This context provides:
    * The `user` object (representing the currently authenticated user).
    * The `token` (JWT for API authentication).
    * An `isAuthenticated` boolean flag indicating login status.
    * An `isLoading` boolean flag (for the initial authentication check on app load).
    * `login()` and `logout()` methods to manage user sessions and update the global state.
* **Local Component State:** Handled using React's `useState` hook for managing form inputs (especially with React Hook Form), displaying component-specific error messages, and controlling UI toggles (e.g., loading states).

---

### 14. Routing

Client-side routing is powered by `react-router-dom`.

* Routes are comprehensively defined in `src/App.jsx`, utilizing lazy loading (`React.lazy` and `Suspense`) for page components to optimize initial load performance and bundle splitting.
* **`ProtectedRoute.jsx`**: A custom higher-order component that intelligently checks the authentication status (from `AuthContext`) and user role (if `allowedRoles` are specified) before granting access to a route. It redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` or unauthorized users to `/unauthorized` as needed, ensuring a secure and controlled user flow.

---

### 15. Styling

* **Global Styles:** Defined in `src/styles/theme.css` (for CSS variables managing colors, fonts, and spacing) and `src/styles/global.css` (for base HTML element styles and resets). These provide a consistent design system.
* **Component-Specific Styles:** **CSS Modules** (`*.module.css`) are utilized for scoping styles to individual components, effectively preventing class name collisions, enhancing modularity, and ensuring maintainability.
* **Design Consistency:** The overarching dark theme and the distinctive accent colors (cyan/gold gradient) from the design samples are applied consistently across the entire application and all components, creating a cohesive and branded user experience.

---

### 16. Form Handling & Validation

**React Hook Form** is the chosen library for all forms (Login, Register, Password Reset, Contact, Create Blog, etc.) due to its significant benefits in:

* **Optimized Performance:** Reduces re-renders and provides a smoother user experience.
* **Simplified API:** Easy and flexible for defining validation rules (required fields, pattern matching, custom validation functions).
* **Efficient State Management:** Streamlined management of form state (submission status, error messages, dirty fields).
* **Client-Side Validation:** Provides immediate feedback to the user, enhancing usability and reducing server load.
* **Server-Side Validation:** While client-side validation offers a good UX, the backend API performs the definitive server-side validation to ensure data integrity and security against malicious inputs.

---

### 17. Code Quality

* **ESLint:** Configured to enforce JavaScript coding standards and proactively identify potential errors and anti-patterns. The configuration is found in `.eslintrc.cjs`.
* **Prettier:** Ensures consistent code formatting across the entire codebase, eliminating style debates and improving readability. The configuration is in `.prettierrc.json`.

It is highly recommended to run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` regularly during development. Integrating these commands with your VS Code setup (e.g., format-on-save) is strongly encouraged for a streamlined development workflow.

---

### 18. Deployment

1.  **Build the application:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command compiles and optimizes the React application using Vite, generating production-ready static assets within the `dist/` directory.

2.  **Deploy static assets:**
    The generated `dist/` folder can be deployed to any static site hosting service, such as:
    * Vercel (recommended, as configured in the monorepo root)
    * Netlify
    * GitHub Pages
    * AWS S3 + CloudFront
    * Firebase Hosting

3.  **SPA Routing Configuration:**
    Ensure your chosen hosting provider is configured to handle **Single Page Application (SPA) routing** correctly. This typically involves redirecting all paths that are not direct static file requests to `index.html`, allowing React Router to manage the client-side routes.
    * **Vercel:** Usually handles this automatically. If custom redirects are needed, they can be configured via a `vercel.json` file.
    * **Netlify:** Create a `public/_redirects` file with the rule: `/* /index.html 200`.

---

### 19. Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues:
* Verify that the backend server is actively running and accessible at the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` defined in your `frontend/.env` file.
* Check your browser's developer console (Network tab) for any **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** errors. Ensure your backend's CORS configuration explicitly allows requests from your frontend's origin (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for local development, or your deployed Vercel URL).

### Login/Registration Failures:
* Examine the browser console for network errors or specific error messages returned from the backend API.
* Verify that the data payloads sent from the frontend forms (in the Network tab of dev tools) exactly match the expectations of the backend API.
* Ensure that the backend database is connected and fully operational.

### Styling Discrepancies:
* Confirm that CSS Modules are imported correctly (e.g., `import styles from './MyComponent.module.css';`).
* Check for potential CSS specificity conflicts or typographical errors in class names.
* Utilize your browser's developer tools to inspect elements and trace the applied styles.

### Environment Variables Not Loading:
* Ensure that all frontend environment variables intended for client-side use are correctly prefixed with `VITE_`.
* Always restart the Vite development server (`npm run dev`) after making any changes to your `.env` files.
